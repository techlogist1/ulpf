# ULPF decisions record

Format per entry: **Decision** · **Principle** · **Ruled out** (the specific alternative
and why). A principle with no decision is noise; a decision with no alternative was not
decided.

## D1. Crate boundaries: time / store / parse / normalize / cli
**Decision.** Five crates: `ulpf-time` (calendar + format parsing, zero deps),
`ulpf-store` (framing, append-only raw store, offsets index, SQLite catalogue),
`ulpf-parse` (definitions, four strategies, detection, Template), `ulpf-normalize`
(mappings, OCSF subset), `ulpf` (engine, metrics, CLI). Dependency direction:
cli → {store, parse, normalize, time}; normalize → parse (for the `ParsedEvent` type
only); parse → time. `parse` never depends on `normalize`.
**Principle.** Information hiding; the parser/mapping wall enforced by the dependency
graph rather than by review. Sub-agent isolation: a worker owning `ulpf-time` cannot
touch the parser runtime.
**Ruled out.** A `ulpf-core` crate for shared types (would hold three structs and no
behaviour — a crate for a stub). Inference and server crates now (nothing exists to put
in them yet).

## D2. Repository root is the working directory
**Decision.** The repo is initialised in `…/ssh hackathon` itself and named `ulpf` on
GitHub. **Principle.** Fresh Claude Code sessions in this directory auto-load
`CLAUDE.md`. **Ruled out.** A nested `ulpf/` folder (extra `cd` in every session, no
benefit).

## D3. Queue: `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`, block-on-full
**Decision.** Ingest→process is a bounded `sync_channel` of batches; when full the
ingest thread blocks. **Principle.** Pull complexity downward: the one policy that never
loses data is chosen by the engine, not configured by the operator. **Ruled out.**
`crossbeam-channel` (a dependency for a feature stdlib has); drop-on-full (violates raw
completeness); unbounded (grows until the process dies under load).

## D4. Repo hygiene: lead commits, workers never commit
**Decision.** Only the lead runs git. Workers use a private `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to avoid
build-lock contention. **Principle.** One writer per shared resource. **Ruled out.**
Worker commits (interleaved half-states on `main`).
